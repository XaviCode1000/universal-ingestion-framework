If you hit your daily request limits or exhaust your Gemini Pro quota even after upgrading, the most flexible solution is to switch to a pay-as-you-go model, where you pay for the specific amount of processing you use. This is the recommended path for uninterrupted access.

To do this, log in using a Gemini API key or Vertex AI.

It's important to highlight that when using an API key, you pay per token/call. This can be more expensive for many small calls with few tokens, but it's the only way to ensure your workflow isn't interrupted by quota limits.

These plans currently apply only to the use of Gemini web-based products provided by Google-based experiences (for example, the Gemini web app or the Flow video editor). These plans do not apply to the API usage which powers the Gemini CLI. Supporting these plans is under active consideration for future support.

When using a Pay as you Go API key, be mindful of your usage to avoid unexpected costs.
