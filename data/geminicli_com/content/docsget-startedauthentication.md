To use Gemini CLI, you'll need to authenticate with Google. This guide helps you quickly find the best way to sign in based on your account type and how you're using the CLI.

For most users, we recommend starting Gemini CLI and logging in with your personal Google account.

Select the authentication method that matches your situation in the table below:

| User Type / Scenario | Recommended Authentication Method | Google Cloud Project Required |
|---|---|---|
| Individual Google accounts | Login with Google | No, with exceptions |
| Organization users with a company, school, or Google Workspace account | Login with Google | Yes |
| AI Studio user with a Gemini API key | Use Gemini API Key | No |
| Google Cloud Vertex AI user | Vertex AI | Yes |
| Headless mode | Use Gemini API Key or Vertex AI | No (for Gemini API Key) Yes (for Vertex AI) |

**Individual Google accounts:** Includes all
free tier accounts such as Gemini Code
Assist for individuals, as well as paid subscriptions for
Google AI Pro and Ultra.

**Organization accounts:** Accounts using paid licenses through an
organization such as a company, school, or
Google Workspace. Includes
Google AI Ultra for Business
subscriptions.

If you run Gemini CLI on your local machine, the simplest authentication method is logging in with your Google account. This method requires a web browser on a machine that can communicate with the terminal running Gemini CLI (e.g., your local machine).

Important:If you are aGoogle AI ProorGoogle AI Ultrasubscriber, use the Google account associated with your subscription.

To authenticate and use Gemini CLI:

Start the CLI:

Select **Login with Google**. Gemini CLI opens a login prompt using your web
browser. Follow the on-screen instructions. Your credentials will be cached
locally for future sessions.

Most individual Google accounts (free and paid) don't require a Google Cloud project for authentication. However, you'll need to set a Google Cloud project when you meet at least one of the following conditions:

For instructions, see Set your Google Cloud Project.

If you don't want to authenticate using your Google account, you can use an API key from Google AI Studio.

To authenticate and use Gemini CLI with a Gemini API key:

Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio.

Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY`

environment variable to your key. For example:

To make this setting persistent, see Persisting Environment Variables.

Start the CLI:

Select **Use Gemini API key**.

Warning:Treat API keys, especially for services like Gemini, as sensitive credentials. Protect them to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of the service under your account.

To use Gemini CLI with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform, choose from the following authentication options:

`gcloud`

.Regardless of your authentication method for Vertex AI, you'll need to set
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`

to your Google Cloud project ID with the Vertex AI API
enabled, and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`

to the location of your Vertex AI resources
or the location where you want to run your jobs.

For example:

To make any Vertex AI environment variable settings persistent, see Persisting Environment Variables.

`gcloud`

Consider this authentication method if you have Google Cloud CLI installed.

Note:If you have previously set`GOOGLE_API_KEY`

or`GEMINI_API_KEY`

, you must unset them to use ADC:

Verify you have a Google Cloud project and Vertex AI API is enabled.

Log in to Google Cloud:

Start the CLI:

Select **Vertex AI**.

Consider this method of authentication in non-interactive environments, CI/CD pipelines, or if your organization restricts user-based ADC or API key creation.

Note:If you have previously set`GOOGLE_API_KEY`

or`GEMINI_API_KEY`

, you must unset them:

Create a service account and key and download the provided JSON file. Assign the "Vertex AI User" role to the service account.

Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

environment variable to the JSON
file's absolute path. For example:

Start the CLI:

Select **Vertex AI**.

Warning:Protect your service account key file as it gives access to your resources.

Obtain a Google Cloud API key: Get an API Key.

Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

environment variable:

Note:If you see errors like`"API keys are not supported by this API..."`

, your organization might restrict API key usage for this service. Try the other Vertex AI authentication methods instead.

Start the CLI:

Select **Vertex AI**.

Important:Most individual Google accounts (free and paid) don't require a Google Cloud project for authentication.

When you sign in using your Google account, you may need to configure a Google Cloud project for Gemini CLI to use. This applies when you meet at least one of the following conditions:

To configure Gemini CLI to use a Google Cloud project, do the following:

Configure your environment variables. Set either the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`

or `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`

variable to the project ID to use with Gemini
CLI. Gemini CLI checks for `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`

first, then falls back to
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`

.

For example, to set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`

variable:

To make this setting persistent, see Persisting Environment Variables.

To avoid setting environment variables for every terminal session, you can persist them with the following methods:

**Add your environment variables to your shell configuration file:** Append
the `export ...`

commands to your shell's startup file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`

,
`~/.zshrc`

, or `~/.profile`

) and reload your shell (e.g.,
`source ~/.bashrc`

).

Warning:Be aware that when you export API keys or service account paths in your shell configuration file, any process launched from that shell can read them.

**Use a .env file:** Create a

`.gemini/.env`

file in your project
directory or home directory. Gemini CLI automatically loads variables from
the first `.env`

file it finds, searching up from the current directory,
then in `~/.gemini/.env`

or `~/.env`

. `.gemini/.env`

is recommended.Example for user-wide settings:

Variables are loaded from the first file found, not merged.

When running Gemini CLI within certain Google Cloud environments, authentication is automatic.

In a Google Cloud Shell environment, Gemini CLI typically authenticates automatically using your Cloud Shell credentials. In Compute Engine environments, Gemini CLI automatically uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) from the environment's metadata server.

If automatic authentication fails, use one of the interactive methods described on this page.

Headless mode will use your existing authentication method, if an existing authentication credential is cached.

If you have not already logged in with an authentication credential, you must configure authentication using environment variables:

Your authentication method affects your quotas, pricing, Terms of Service, and privacy notices. Review the following pages to learn more:
